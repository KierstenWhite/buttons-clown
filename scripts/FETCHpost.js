// Review for Tommy for Fetch/Post


/* Here are the four main methods used on HTTP requests.

Method	Description
GET	Please give me this resource.
POST	Please create something new.
PUT	Please modify an existing resource.
DELETE	Please delete an existing. */

/* Fetching - we fetch milk from the grocery store 
2nd .then - going into the fridge to get the milk (the fridge is state)


export const sendWithADescriptiveTitle = (parameter so you can known what package you intend to send) => {



    return fetch(`address - so the store`,{
        anything in here is the procedures employees must follow
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(knowing what it is going to save)
    
    )

    
    return fetch(`${API}/requests`, fetchOptions) <- fetchOptions just stores the instructions from the fetch call so it's not as messy and cleaner code

    ctrl + d will change all variable names in a file
    ctrl + c at end of the line will paste copy right under that line
}
